## Real Time Process Synchronization Analysis

# 1. Introduction

Process synchronization is a fundamental concept in operating systems, ensuring that multiple processes execute in an orderly and efficient manner. The Real-Time Process Synchronization Analyzer is a tool designed to monitor and analyze process synchronization, helping to prevent race conditions and deadlocks. This project provides a user-friendly GUI-based system to visualize real-time process execution and synchronization.

# 2. Features

- Real-time Process Monitoring

- Process Prioritization Based on CPU Usage

- Graphical and Tabular Representation of Process Synchronization

- Deadlock Detection and Analysis

- Process Communication Analysis

- Resource Allocation Visualization

# 3. Technologies Used

- Python (Core Programming Language)

- Tkinter (GUI Development)

- Psutil (Process Monitoring)

- Queue Module (Process Execution Management)

- Matplotlib (Graphical Visualization)

- Threading Module (Real-time Execution)

# 4. Usage

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with dependencies: pip install psutil matplotlib

- Launch the application using python main.py.

- Click "Show Processes" to view currently running processes.

- Click "Analyze Synchronization" to visualize process execution order.

- Monitor real-time CPU usage and process prioritization.

- View deadlock warnings and suggested resolutions.

# 5. Dashboard Preview

The Real-Time Process Synchronization Analyzer interface includes:

- A real-time process monitoring table.

- A priority-based synchronization table.

- Graphical charts displaying process execution order.

- Buttons for process list retrieval and synchronization analysis.

- Deadlock detection notifications.

# 6. How It Works

- Uses psutil to fetch active processes in real-time.

- Sorts processes based on CPU utilization to determine execution priority.

- Displays process details in tabular format.

- Implements queue-based scheduling for synchronization visualization.

- Provides graphical representation using matplotlib.

- Monitors for deadlocks and suggests resolution mechanisms.

- Updates the process list dynamically every few seconds.

- Ensures smooth UI experience with efficient threading techniques.

# 7. Future Enhancements

- Introduce support for multi-threaded process synchronization testing.

- Implement AI-based prediction models for deadlock detection.

- Enhance graphical insights with real-time animation.

- Allow user-defined process scheduling policies.

- Improve resource allocation tracking with advanced logging mechanisms.
