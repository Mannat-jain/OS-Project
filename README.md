# Real Time Process Synchronization Analysis

1. Introduction

Process synchronization is a fundamental concept in operating systems, ensuring that multiple processes execute in an orderly and efficient manner. The Real-Time Process Synchronization Analyzer is a tool designed to monitor and analyze process synchronization, helping to prevent race conditions and deadlocks. This project provides a user-friendly GUI-based system to visualize real-time process execution and synchronization.
